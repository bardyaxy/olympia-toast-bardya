          <p>
            Hey, I'm Bardya. I moved to the U.S. at 16 and settled in Bellevue,
            WA. Adjusting to a new life and completely different culture as a
            teenager shaped me. It taught me resilience, openness, and a deep
            appreciation for tight knit communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned my degree in Chemical Engineering and spent my early
            professional life in technical sales, working closely with
            scientists and engineers. But I felt something was missing. I wanted
            to make a direct impact, something I could clearly see and feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for food, travel, and culture has led me to countless
            restaurants around the world, seeing firsthand the daily challenges
            owners face. Small businesses like yours are truly the heartbeat of
            our neighborhoods, and today, they're facing tougher times than
            ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm new to Toast, but I'm bringing genuine curiosity and a personal
            drive to help Olympia's restaurant community thrive. This entire
            website you're on right now? I built it myself. It took over
            50&nbsp;hours and more than 5,000 lines of code without any
            outsourcing, agency help, or even direct assistance from Toast. It’s
            important to me because this is exactly how committed I’ll be to you
            and your restaurant's success.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working, you'll probably find me behind my camera,
            capturing food, nature, and adventures from my travels. I'd love to
            share those moments with you. Check out my photography journey on
            Instagram
